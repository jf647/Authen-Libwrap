Revision history for Perl extension Authen::Libwrap.

0.10    Tue Feb 13 2001
        - Three years and *still* nobody wrote something like this ? 
        - Cleaned up a bit, verified on FreeBSD 4.x
	- renamed from TCP_Wrappers to Authen::Libwrap in prep for
	distribution on CPAN

[...]   History unknown.  Module never received much fedback, so it wasn't
        uploaded to CPAN.

0.003   Fri Apr 3 1998
	- Released to a few interested parties from comp.lang.perl.modules

0.002	Wed Apr 1 1998
	- I couldn't quite bring myself to release this on April Fool's day
	(as appropriate as it may have been)

0.001	Mon Mar 27 1998
	- Damn! It compiles (and seems to work to boot!)
