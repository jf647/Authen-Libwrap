NAME
    Authen::Libwrap - access to Wietse Venema's TCP Wrappers library

SYNOPSIS
      use Authen::Libwrap qw( hosts_ctl STRING_UNKNOWN );

      # we know the remote username (using identd)
      $rc = hosts_ctl(      "programname",
                            "hostname.domain.com",
                            "10.1.1.1",
                            "username" );
      );
      print "Access is ", $rc ? "granted" : "refused", "\n";

      # we don't know the remote username
      $rc = hosts_ctl(      "programname",
                            "hostname.domain.com",
                            "10.1.1.1",
                            STRING_UNKNOWN );
      );
      print "Access is ", $rc ? "granted" : "refused", "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    The Authen::Libwrap module allows you to access the hosts_ctl() function
    from the popular TCP Wrappers security package. This allows validation
    of network access from perl programs against the system-wide hosts.allow
    file.

    If any of the parameters to hosts_ctl() are not known (i.e. username due
    to lack of an identd server), the constant STRING_UNKNOWN should be
    passed to the function.

EXPORTS
      Nothing unless you ask for it.

      hosts_ctl( $daemon, $hostname, $ip_address, $username );

CONSTANTS
      STRING_UNKNOWN

BUGS
    Calls to hosts_ctl() which match a line in hosts.allow that uses the
    "twist" option will terminate the running perl program. This is not a
    bug in Authen::Libwrap per se -- libwrap uses exec(3) to replace the
    running process with the specified program, so there's nothing to return
    to.

    Some operating systems ship with a default catch-all rule in hosts.allow
    that uses the twist option. You may have to modify this configuration to
    use Authen::Libwrap effectively.

SEE ALSO
    Authen::Tcpdmatch, a Pure Perl module that can parse hosts.allow and
    hosts.deny if you don't need all the underlying features of libwrap.
