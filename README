This is the Authen::Libwrap XSUB for Perl5, version 0.10.

Verified to work on:
	HP-UX 10.20 with libwrap 7.6
	HP-UX 11.0 with libwrap 7.6
	FreeBSD 4.x with libwrap 7.6
    FreeBSD 5.1

You must have compiled and installed the TCP Wrappers package.  The home
page for TCP Wrappers is ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html.

You should compile libwrap to position-indenpendant code (PIC).  On gcc,
add the '-fpic' switch to CFLAGS.  On HP-UX, add '+z' (you'll need the
optional Ansi C compiler to do that though).

Makefile.PL is functional, but rather sparse.  Briefly:

- Edit Makefile.PL to reflect the locations of libwrap.a and tcpd.h (LIBS and
INCS - mine are set to /usr/local/{lib,include} respectively.)
- Run 'perl Makefile.PL'
- Run 'make'
- Run 'make install'

Report any problems or bugs to James FitzGibbon <james@ehlo.com>.  If
everything works perfectly, please send me the output of 'perl -V' so that I
can add it to the list of verified systems.


GOTCHAS
-------
Calls to hosts_ctl that match hosts.allow entries like this:

# The rest of the daemons are protected. Backfinger and log by email.
ALL : ALL \
	: severity auth.info : spawn (/usr/bin/finger -l @%h | \
	 /usr/bin/mail -s "tcpd\: %u@%h[%a] tried to use %d  (denied)" root ) & \
	: twist /bin/echo "You are not welcome here."

will terminate the running perl program. This is not a bug in
Authen::Libwrap per se -- libwrap uses exec(3) to replace the running
process with the specified program, so there's nothing to return to.  A C
program linked against libwrap does the same thing.

FreeBSD ships with a suggestedcatch-all rule like the one above; you may
consider using "spawn" instead of "twist" to get around this problem.


TODO
----

- Provide interface to hosts_access and request_* functions to allow alternate
parameter passing (i.e. a IO::Socket::INET object instead of the literal
Hostname and IP address)
